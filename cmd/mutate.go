	Short: "Mutate student repos by running 'plugin' code",
	Long: `Mutate makes changes to student repos by running an external program/executable named
'mutate' in the project directory of the assignments repo. 'mutate' must be executable but can be
implemented in any programming language.
'mutate' will be run as follows:
	./mutate student_unix_name student_id student_repo_dir
		student_unix_name is the first portion of an @usc.edu email
		student_id is the USC ID
		student_repo_dir is the path to the project directory in a temporary clone

	It is up to the 'mutate' program to make any necessary modifications to the repo, 'git commit' and
		'git push'
	A non-zero exit code will be recorded as a failure and the student will be logged to csci logs.
`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		fmt.Println("mutate called")

	RootCmd.AddCommand(mutateCmd)

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// mutateCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// mutateCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
